## Strong Evidence

The measure has been validated against the gold-standard Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) across multiple studies with healthcare professionals, showing consistent psychometric properties [1-4].

**Correlation with Emotional Exhaustion:** In physician populations, the single-item measure correlated at r = 0.64 (p < 0.0001) with the MBI emotional exhaustion subscale, with an R² of 0.5 [1,2].

**Sensitivity and Specificity:** The measure demonstrated specificity of 94.7% for clinicians and 92.3% for staff, though sensitivity was more moderate at 50.4% for clinicians and 58.6% for staff, with area under the ROC curve of 0.82 for clinicians and 0.81 for staff [3].

**Validity Across Populations:** The tool has been tested across diverse occupational groups including primary care providers, registered nurses, clinical associates, and administrative clerks, with remarkably consistent results [4-6].

## Important Limitations

Research with medical students found that while the single-item measure correlates well with emotional exhaustion, it may not adequately capture depersonalization, which is an important aspect of burnout that affects therapeutic relationships with patients [7,8].

The self-defined single-item measure tends to produce lower burnout prevalence estimates compared to the full MBI (29% vs 52% in one study of clinicians) [3].

## Bottom Line

This is a validated, practical screening tool that's particularly good at detecting emotional exhaustion—the core component of burnout. However, it should be viewed as a screening measure rather than a comprehensive diagnostic tool. Its high specificity means it's good at ruling out burnout, though its moderate sensitivity means some cases may be missed.
